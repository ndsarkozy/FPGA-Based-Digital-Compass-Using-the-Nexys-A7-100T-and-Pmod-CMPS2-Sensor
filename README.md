# FPGA-Based-Digital-Compass-Using-the-Nexys-A7-100T-and-Pmod-CMPS2-Sensor
This project implements a real-time digital compass on the Nexys A7-100T FPGA development board using the Pmod CMPS2 magnetometer sensor. The system measures Earth's magnetic field to determine orientation relative to magnetic north and displays the heading angle in degrees on the onboard seven-segment display.
